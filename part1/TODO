Need to do the Following:

A. (***TODO***)

Count up from 1 instead of down from 99. After this, your program should output something like
1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 2 bottles of beer on the wall.

2 bottles of beer on the wall, 2 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 3 bottles of beer on the wall.

...

99 bottles of beer on the wall, 99 bottles of beer.
Take one down, pass it around, 100 bottles of beer on the wall.

B. (***TODO***)

Of course that doesn't make much sense. So change the lyrics to look like:
1 line of text on the screen, 1 line of text.
Print it out, stand up and shout, 2 lines of text on the screen.

2 lines of text on the screen, 2 lines of text.
Print it out, stand up and shout, 3 lines of text on the screen.

...

99 lines of text on the screen, 99 lines of text.
Print it out, stand up and should, 100 lines of text on the screen.
  
Actually, you can change the lyrics to whatever you like, as long as it follows this general pattern (should be counting up something in the lyrics from 1 to 100). Nothing you'd be embarrassed to sing though...

C. (***TODO***)

Instead of counting up by 1 every time, choose a random number between 1 and 10 and increment by that. Since it's random, I should get a different output every time I run your program.

D.(***TODO***)

Display a prompt like "How many lines? " and read an integer from the terminal. Then stop the song when you hit that number (instead of 100).


G. (***TODO***)

Print each number fully factored into its prime factors. For instance, 1 should print as () - an empty pair of parentheses, 2 will print as (2), 24 as (2*2*2*3), etc.
