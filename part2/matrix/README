Basic Matrix Calculator. Reads in and performs either addition, subtraction, and multiplication on matrices of integers until the user exits.

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. respond to the prompt with "0", "1", "2", "3" to exit the program, add matrices, subtract matrices, or multiply matrices. (if "0" is entered or any 
	undefined integer, the program will terminate.)

2. give the requested dimensions to the program in integer format.

3. fill the matrix one item at a time with an integer. the prompt is asking for each element by "row column" format (i.e. "Enter element 'row' 'column': ).

4. matrices are printed out to user in human readable format:

		 M_1 

		 "OP" 

		 M_2 

		 = 

		 M_3

5. return to step 1.

Compile and run with this:
